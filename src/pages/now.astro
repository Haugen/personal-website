    <h2>Working at Volvo Cars</h2>
    <p>
      Since April 2023 I've been working full time at Volvo Cars in Gothenburg,
      working with both product and platform teams to improve and enhance their <a
        href="https://www.volvocars.com/">external website</a
      >. In January I went from being a consultant to being employed as a Staff
      Engineer, focusing more on big picture tech and organisational efficiency.

    <h2>Golf</h2>
    <p>
      This Summer I got hooked by golf. Got by green card, and have played a lot
      since. My current handicap is ~35.
