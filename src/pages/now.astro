    returning to teaching at Yrgo.

    <h2>Working at Volvo Cars</h2>
    <p>
      Since April 2023 I've been a full time consultant at Volvo Cars in
      Gothenburg, working with both product and platform teams to improve and
      enhance their <a href="https://www.volvocars.com/">external website</a>.

    <h2>Teaching at Yrgo</h2>
    <p>
      I'm teaching a class in HTML and CSS for Digital Designers at Yrgo between
      September and November.

    <h2>Studying Golang</h2>
    <p>
      After spending years exclusively in the realm of TypeScript, I'm studying
      Golang to further broaden my knowledge. Right now, I'm reading
      <a href="https://www.amazon.se/-/en/Jon-Bodner/dp/1492077216"
        >Learning Go: An Idiomatic Approach to Real-World Go Programming</a
      > and <a href="https://github.com/Haugen/bcu">writing a small CLI</a>.
