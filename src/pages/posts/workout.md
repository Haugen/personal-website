About six months ago I started working out. After a lifetime of not really being interested in weight lifting, and never had any habits of doing it, I've been lifting weight on average 3 times per week over the last six months. It's time for a little reflection on how I managed to get into this habit, and how I've progressed along the way.

## Why I started

I'm always been exercising one way or another, but never really strength training. As an adolescence I was playing both football and ice hockey, and as an adult I've been an avid runner and a long time practitioner of multiple styles of yoga. But last year, as I was approaching my 37th birthday, I came to reflect on my health and fitness, and realized I was really missing out on a lot of the benefits of strength training.

In the past I've had a couple of attempts on starting, but never managed to make a habit out of it. I would be motivated to start, hit the gym without a plan, and quickly loose both motivation and momentum. I didn't know what I was doing, and I had no plan going in. This was a big mistake and a cause for my failure.

## The two habits that made it stick

There were really two key habits that helped me stick with a regular schedule for these last five months.

### 1. Create a plan

This time, I knew I needed a plan. I wasn't going to go to the gym without having any idea what I was doing. My friend recommended me the [StrongLifts 5x5 Workout Program](https://stronglifts.com/5x5/), which is a simple and effective program for beginners that has been around for over 60 years. The program consists of two workouts:

1. Workout A: Squat, Bench Press, Barbell Row.
2. Workout B: Squat, Overhead Press, Deadlift.

Both programs start with squats, followed by two other exercises. Each exercise is done 5x5, five sets with five repetitions each. The recommended schedule is doing the program three times per week, alternating between Workout A and Workout B.

It immediately appealed to me. The simplicity. The exercises. The schedule. I was exactly what I needed to get started. Not further questions asked.

### 2. Track progress

The second key habit was tracking my progress. The same friend who recommended the StrongLifts program also recommended the app [StrengthLog](https://www.strengthlog.com/). Again, no questions asked. I downloaded the app, and was all set.

Since day 1, I started tracking my progress in the app. This helped with two major things. First, it made it easy to remember the actual weights I had used in the gym. Second, it was really motivating seeing the progress I was making, being able to record higher weights over time.

Lastly, I have to give a big shout-out to the support team over at StrengthLog. I recently contacted them with an issue I had with changing how I signed in, and they provided excellent support.

## The results

Now after five months, it's time for a summary, and aggregate some of the data I've been gathering over the months. Let's first take a look at some general stats before diving into the details of each exercise.

## Conclusion

Strength training has felt great over these last five months. During and after the workouts, it's definitely a different high than with running and yoga. Also, the feeling of getting stronger over time is really motivating.

After this first chapter with strength, I'm now switching up my routine completely. It's time to pursue something I've always wanted to do, but never been able to. Pull ups and Chin ups. This is the next chapter. How long it'll take, I don't know. But whenever I get there, expect a post about it.
