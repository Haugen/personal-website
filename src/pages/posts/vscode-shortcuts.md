As a developer, using your keyboard as much as possible is a great way to increase your productivity. It may not seem much, but all those seconds saved here and there add up over time. Here are some of the shortcuts I find most useful in VS Code.

Cmd - Shift - E

Toggle between explorer and file (space to open file)

Cmd + B

Show/Hide the file explorer

Cmd + J

Show/Hide the Panel

Cmd + Shfit + K

Delete the current line

Cmd + X

Without selecting anything, cut the whole line

Cmd + D

Select a word. Use Cmd + D to keep selecting the same word in the same file. Then do multi cursor edit.

Cmd + arrow keys

Jump to Top/Bottom of file (arrows up and down). Or jump to beginning/end of line (arrows left and right).

Option + left/right

Move cursor a whole word left or right. Very usesful for navigating within a single line of code.

Option + up/right

Move the selected line (or lines) up or down.

Cmd + P

Free text search for a file.

Cmd + Shift + P

Open up the command pallet.

Cmd + Shift + F

Go to search.
