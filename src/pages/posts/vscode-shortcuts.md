As a developer, using your keyboard as much as possible is a great way to increase your productivity. It may not seem much, but all those seconds saved here and there add up over time. Here are some of the shortcuts I find most useful in VS Code.

## Navigating the editor

The first type of shortcut you need to consider is moving around in your editor. Browsing your file tree. Opening new files. Moving between different sections in your editor. The more you can use your keyboard for this, the faster you'll eventually become moving around in your code base.

### `Cmd + Shift + E`

Toggle between file explorer and open file. When in file explorer, use arrow keys to navigate and `space` to open a file.

### `Cmd + B`

Show/Hide the left (by default) sidebar, where the file explorer, search, etc, are.

### `Cmd + J`

Show/Hide the Panel. This is normally where you keep your VS Code terminal.

### `Ctrl + Shift + Â´`

Toggle between file window and terminal window. Normally I use this over `cmd + j` as it helps to just move focus to the terminal if it's already open (but not focused).

## Navigating inside files

Besides navigating your overall code editor, you also should be able to move around a file with your keyboard. This next section covers some of the shortcuts I use to move around inside a file.

## Editing files

Eventually we want to made edits to the files we're navigating. Adding, removing, duplicating, copying/pasting, etc, content.

### `Cmd + Shift + K`

Delete the current line. It doesn't matter where on the line your cursor is.

### `Cmd + X`

We all know we can cut text with `cmd + x`. But if you don't have any text selected, the command will cut the whole line where your cursor is focused.

## Multi cursor editing

### `Cmd + D`

Select a word. Use Cmd + D to keep selecting the same word in the same file. Then do multi cursor edit.

Cmd + arrow keys

Jump to Top/Bottom of file (arrows up and down). Or jump to beginning/end of line (arrows left and right).

Option + left/right

Move cursor a whole word left or right. Very usesful for navigating within a single line of code.

Option + up/right

Move the selected line (or lines) up or down.

Cmd + P

Free text search for a file.

Cmd + Shift + P

Open up the command pallet.

Cmd + Shift + F

Go to search.
