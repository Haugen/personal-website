After a lifetime of not being interested in weight lifting, and never had any habits of doing it, I've been lifting weight on average 2.3 times per week over the last five months. It's time for some reflection on how I managed to get here, and how I've progressed along the way.

## Why I Started

As an adolescence I was playing both football and ice hockey, and as an adult I've been an avid runner and a long time practitioner of multiple styles of yoga. But last year, as I was approaching my 37th birthday, I came to reflect on my health and fitness, and realized I was missing out on a lot of the benefits of strength training.

In the past I've made a couple of attempts, but never managed to make a habit out of it. I would be motivated to start, get to the gym a few times, and quickly loose both motivation and momentum. I had no idea what I was doing, and I had no plan going in. This was a big mistake and the reason I had failed in the past.

## Two Habits That Made It Stick

Two things aligned this time around, creating a perfect storm of motivation and momentum. I made a plan, and I tracked my progress.

### 1. The Plan

A friend recommended the [StrongLifts 5x5 Workout Program](https://stronglifts.com/5x5/), which is a simple and effective program for beginners that has been around for over 60 years. The program consists of two workouts:

1. Workout A: Squat, Bench Press, Barbell Row.
1. Workout B: Squat, Overhead Press, Deadlift.

Both programs start with squats, followed by two other exercises. Each exercise is done 5x5, five sets with five repetitions each. The recommended schedule is doing the program three times per week, alternating between Workout A and Workout B.

It immediately appealed to me. The simplicity. The exercises. The schedule. I was exactly what I needed to get started.

### 2. Tracking Progress

The same friend also recommended the app [StrengthLog](https://www.strengthlog.com/) to track my progress. Tracking helped with two major things:

1. It made it easy to remember the actual weights I had used in the gym.
1. It was really motivating seeing the progress I was making, being able to record higher weights over time.

I have to give a big shout-out to the support team over at StrengthLog. I recently contacted them with an issue I had with changing how I signed in, and they provided excellent support.

## The Results

After five months, it's time for a summary, and aggregate some of the data I've been gathering over the months. Let's first take a look at some general stats before diving into the details of each exercise.

### General Stats

- Start date: 2022-11-16
- End date: 2023-04-12
- Weeks training: 21
- Total workouts: **49**
- Total reps: **3,154**
- Total weight lifted: **155.4** ton
- Average workouts per week: **2.3**

During my third month I had some rough times in my personal life. I would miss plenty of gym sessions, but eventually managed to get myself back on track. This is visible in the stats below, where the increase in strength is smaller or non-existence between month 2 and 3.

### Squats

I really enjoyed squats, and have a very open hip from all the yoga practice.

| 1 month | 2 months | 3 months | 4 months | 5 months |
| ------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 47 kg   | 59 kg    | 60 kg    | 65 kg    | 70 kg    |
|         | +25%     | +1.7%    | +8.3%    | +7.7%    |

### Bench Press

I progressed a bit slower here than in the other exercises. Not sure why. Perhaps I was afraid on loading too much weight on, and not being able to complete the last rep.

| 1 month | 2 months | 3 months | 4 months | 5 months |
| ------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 39 kg   | 44 kg    | 45 kg    | 47 kg    | 50 kg    |
|         | +13%     | +2.3%    | +4.4%    | +6.4%    |

### Barbell Row

During my last month, I changed the way I did the barbell row, which made it harder. Therefore, I ended up reducing my weight in the last month.

| 1 month | 2 months | 3 months | 4 months | 5 months |
| ------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 37 kg   | 47 kg    | 47 kg    | 50 kg    | 45 kg    |
|         | +27%     | +0%      | +6.4%    | -10%     |

### Overhead Press

Felt really good with the steady progression here as well. Really noticed how I was getting stronger in my arms and shoulders in this press.

| 1 month | 2 months | 3 months | 4 months | 5 months |
| ------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 27 kg   | 34 kg    | 34 kg    | 37 kg    | 40 kg    |
|         | +25%     | +0%      | +8.8%    | +8.1%    |

### Deadlift

Really happy I made it to three digits in kilograms here. Deadlift, what an epic exercise!

| 1 month | 2 months | 3 months | 4 months | 5 months |
| ------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 70 kg   | 82 kg    | 82 kg    | 90 kg    | 100 kg   |
|         | +17%     | +0%      | +9.8%    | +11.1%   |

## Conclusion

Strength training has felt excellent over these last five months. During and after the workouts, it's definitely a different high than with running and yoga. The feeling of getting significantly stronger in my body has been great.

After this first chapter, I'm now switching up my routine completely. It's time to pursue something I've always wanted to be able to do, but never could. Pull ups and Chin ups. This is my next chapter in strength training. How long it'll take, I don't know. But whenever I get there, expect a post about it.

Thank you for making it all the way to the end. Now go to the gym!
