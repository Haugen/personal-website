The goal with this first class is to get our environment setup (browser and text editor) and get a first introduction to HTML and CSS. What it is, and how it works.

## Exercises

### 1. Browser and Text Editor

Before we even get started, we need a browser and a text editor. For web development I personally prefer and recommend [Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en_sv/chrome), but you are free to use any browser you want.

The most popular text editor is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (VS Code). This is what I use, and recommend you use as well. If you already prefer another text editor, feel free to use that one.

As a first step, make sure you have a text editor and your preferred browser installed.

### 2. Get familiar with HTML and CSS

Two introduction articles are available for this first class.

1. [An introduction to HTML](html-intro)
2. [An introduction to CSS](css-intro)

If you are completely new to HTML and CSS i recommend reading through both of them to get an initial sense of what it is and how it works.

### 3. Setup your first website

Create a new folder somewhere on your computer for this web portfolio project we'll be working with during this course. In it, create a file called `index.html`. This will be the homepage of your website. Copy the template below to your new HTML file:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="sv">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>My Portfolio</title>
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```

This setup is a reasonable start for any website. If you're curious, look up what the two `meta` tags included in `head` are for.
