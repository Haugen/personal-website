The feeling of having to do something different is apparent. It's often clear what **not** to do, but what to do instead is less obvious. I end up defaulting to vague tasks like "reading", "writing" and "meditating". For years I've maintained a habit of writing in notebooks, in diary form, but writing and publishing online has kept escaping me.

## Why write?

I can't remember where it comes from, but some variant of "to write clearly is to think clearly" has kept attracting me. Vague ideas constantly occupy my mind, about my personal and professional life, but they're hard to describe clearly. To write is to think. To learn how to write clearly is to practice how to think clearly. An effort in writing is inevitably an effort in thinking and organizing ones thoughts. Mainly for ones self, but side effects include being able to communicate better and being able to better argue for ones ideas.

## What's holding you back?

Why I'm not writing and publishing more is mostly because of fear. Fear of being judged. Fear of having alternative opinions. If you don't write and publish, at least they can't make fun of you. It's always something I've struggle with. But the few times I've written and published, the experience has only been positive, leaving behindg a satisfying and motivating sense of achomplishment. Still, a long lasting habit in writing and publishing regularly has gone missing.

With these "notes", I'm once again making an effort to put thoughts on paper, and making them public. Overthinking is your enemy. Action, however small, is your friend. An idea from James Clear's newsletter yesterday hit me hard, as they often do.

> The first minute of action is worth more than a year of perfect planning.

So maybe, just maybe, this time I'll make a habit out of it.
