I’m on a mission to increase **wellbeing** and **performance** in tech organizations.

[See what problems I can help you solve](#what-i-offer).

I like it when people are healthy and happy. **Wellbeing** is a big topic in my own life, and it’s always something I hope to share everywhere I go in life, including all professional relationships. It’s about good habits. Sleeping well, eating well, exercising and having relationships you enjoy. People who are healthy and happy will, I believe, also perform better at their job.

I also like it when teams **perform** together. How we do things, how we organize our work, to be the most efficient, is something I think about a lot. The How’s. The planning, board, tickets, playbook. How we do things. I value simplicity in everything I do. As a teacher I also enjoy coaching and mentoring students and junior engineers. Passing on experience, helping people grow professionally.

There are two ends of a spectrum when it comes to your work life.

_Worst Case Scenario:_ There is a lot going on. Too much. Everyone one is stressed but no one gets much done. Things are complex and unclear. **Wellbeing** suffers with stress, worse sleep, worse habits overall. **Performance** suffers. People are less engaged, less motivated.

_Best Case Scenario:_ People are happy and motivated at work. They feel engaged, that they have ownership over their time. They take pride in the work they do. Things are simple and clear. Stress levels are reasonable. **Wellbeing** increase. They sleep better, exercise, eat better, have better relationships. Their \*\*performance\*\* increase.

What I enjoy the most is helping teams and organizations move towards the Best Case Scenario ideal.

## What I Offer

I love tech, and making teams thrive. Whichever role I’m in I make sure to always bring good vibes to work. **Wellbeing** and **performance** is central to what I do. If you’re in need of roles like [Tech Lead](#tech-lead), [Product Owner](#product-owner) and [Frontend/Fullstack engineer](#frontendfullstack-engineer), I might be a good fit for you.

### Tech Lead

This is where I most **enjoy** my work. As a tech lead, I help small to medium sized teams build technical products together, and take responsibility over the technical delivery. I coach and mentor junior engineers, and spent a lot of time with the engineering team to help them with whatever challenges they’re facing. I also help Product plan and guide the team on what to do, and when to do it.

### Product Owner

This is what I want to **explore**. I’ve never held the role as PO, responsible for leading, guiding and plan for the development of the Product. I’ve worked closely with them for many years and have a sense of at least part of their responsibilities. I believe with proper guidance, I would be a great PO. My strength would mostly be around working with a technical team, managing a backlog, managing the teams playbook, owning the process, plan with all other stakeholders, guide the products, etc.

### Frontend/Fullstack engineer

This is where I’m most **experienced**. I have built tech professionally for over ten years, mostly as a an engineer. Focused on coding. Focused on the tech. Over the years, as I’ve gained more seniority, I’ve become more interested and engaged with leadership, planning and processes in technical teams. This has lead me towards a path as Tech Lead over the years. I’m still very invested in tech and spend most of my time in the TypeScript ecosystem with a focus on frontend.
