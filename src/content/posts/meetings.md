There's a meeting pandemic in our industry. Too many calendars are too full of meetings. We rush between back to back meetings. A constant state of stress and busyness, without getting much of value done.


## Meetings and mental health

While our industry is struggling with a meetings pandemic, we're also suffering from mental health issues. It's common for people to regularly burn out. Constantly stressed about a never ending workload. I believe our meeting culture is part of the problem.

Valuable work rarely gets done in meetings. If most of your calendar is filled with meetings, you'll always be busy. Talking about work, without getting much done. Stress will come both from participating in all these meetings, as well as not getting any of your actual work done.
## Avoid large and frequent meetings

Elon Musks leaked email has two great points on meetings.

- Avoid large meetings
- Avoid frequent meetings

The worst would then be a combo of the two. Frequent meetings with a large amount of people. For any topic being brought up, it's not important to the work of most people in the meeting. Frequent meeting disrupts are disrupting flow and is generally not necessary. Most things mentioned in those meetings could just be Slack threads or some other form of async communication.

When I worked for Huge years ago, upper management one time ordered **everyone** to cancel recurring meetings that they own unless they were absolutely necessary.

If not managed, large organizations will move slower and slower despite hiring more and more people, as most people will spend most of their time talking about work rather than doing work.

## CIA sabotage handbook

I've seen the CIA handbook on sabotage before. This blow post was a fun interpretation of it from a tech work perspective: https://erikbern.com/2023/12/13/simple-sabotage-for-software.html

One of my favorite points are:

"Be worried about the propriety of any decision â€” raise the question of whether such action as is contemplated lies within the jurisdiction of the group or whether it might conflict with the policy of some higher echelon."

In large organization, being too careful leads to never being able to make a decision. Someone, somewhere, might have an objection. Needing to figure this out leads to more meetings, more things in progress. Everyone doing this will grid the organization to a halt.

Be bold. Push your product forward. There is value in speed, and we often don't take the cost of moving slowly, and keeping many things in progress at once, into account.

## Meetings are not work

Meetings are rarely an activity that yields valuable work. Rather, it's an activity which purpose is to orgnize or plan work. The meeting itself is a cost. Any valuable work gets done outside of meetings. If everyone sits in meetings most of the time, not much actual work will get done.

Aim to have as few meetings as possible to organize your team and work.

## Poorly run meetings

Have you ever showed up to a meeting where, after a few minutes of cold talk, everyone looks at each other confused and wonders: "what are we doing? why are we here?". Every meeting called, small and big, should have a clear agenda.

## Stop brainstorming in meetings

Gathering a large group of people in a meeting, we should have a goal set in mind. Something needs to be decided on. Information needs to be spread. Something needs to be ironed out. To summon a large group of people to a meeting to "meet and figure things out" is a bad idea. Usually, these meetings end with more questions then when it started, which of course will result in more meetings.

Set a clear goal for the meeting. Provide context and material before hand so that meeting participant can come prepared.

## Great books on the subject

- Deep Work

## Exceptions

There are exceptions to the rules I've outlined below. So called "Town Halls" or "All Hands", where a whole company or gathers regularly for company wide updates, Q and A's, etc, are valuable. My objections are to the more common meeting, within a team, or between a couple of teams within an organization.

Please note I'm not agains people meeting and talking with each other and their work. Quite the opposite. Building teams that work together to solve interesting problems and ship beautiful and well working software is what I've dedicated my career to. This requires people of different disciplines collaborating with each other. What I'm opposing is large, frequent, often meaningless meetings that steal both time and spirit that should be dedicated to ones craft.

## The solution

Realize that meetings are not producing any valuable work. Have as few meetings as possible to get your team organized and productive. Make sure you're meetings have a clear agenda and goal. Ask participants to prepare if necessary. Be bold. Air on the side of speed rather than caution (unless you're building critical, life and death software, which most likely you're not).
