Draft post on meetings, or productivity, or something like that. It's just a craving for writing. To take notes. To keep writing about a topic. When written, to keep editing. To keep going, until I publish, and then start over again.

## Elon Musk email

Elon Musks leaked email has two great points on meetings.

- Avoid large meetings
- Avoid frequent meetings

The worst would then be a combo of the two. Frequent meetings with a large amount of people. For any topic being brought up, it's not important to the work of most people in the meeting. Frequent meeting disrupts are disrupting flow and is generally not necessary. Most things mentioned in those meetings could just be Slack threads or some other form of async communication.

## CIA sabotage handbook

I've seen the CIA handbook on sabotage before. This blow post was a fun interpretation of it from a tech work perspective: https://erikbern.com/2023/12/13/simple-sabotage-for-software.html

One of my favorite points are:

- "Be worried about the propriety of any decision â€” raise the question of whether such action as is contemplated lies within the jurisdiction of the group or whether it might conflict with the policy of some higher echelon."

In large organization, being too careful leads to never being able to make a decision. Someone, somewhere, might have an objection. Needing to figure this out leads to more meetings, more things in progress. Everyone doing this will grid the organization to a halt.

Be bold. Push your product forward. There is value in speed, and we often don't take the cost of moving slowly, and keeping many things in progress at once, into account.
