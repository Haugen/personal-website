“Who are you? Tell us a bit about yourself”.

We often encounter this question in interviews. Recently, I've adopted a new approach to answering it. It’s sharing time!

Before an interview, I now spend time walking and meditating on this question. Who am I? Trying out ideas and values, seeking self-descriptions that resonate. Eventually I end with some notes, but the theme and content of my answer would keep changing.

My last interview revolved around a new insight I had about myself.

I’m curious and adventurous. I like to expose myself to new ideas, places and people. I also value order, stability, routines and habits. It may seem contradictory, but hear me out.

I like to travel. I’m drawn to the esoteric, the unconventional, foreign places, cultures and people. But in my travels I don’t move around much. Instead, I would settle down somewhere, for weeks and months on end, creating stability for myself. Morning routines, finding a nice café and eating the same meal for lunch there every day, spending time reading. Only then, with a stable foundation, I would be fit to explore and take in this foreign place.

I like innovative tech. To explore new ideas in new contexts with new people. But in order to thrive as a professional I need some order. Making an effort to plan and to take control over ones processes. Always trying to find ways to make things better together. Doing fewer things at the same time. Finding a rhythm. From this effort, of trying to bring some order to the complexity of building software, I find it easier to solve difficult problems.
